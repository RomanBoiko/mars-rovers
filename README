==MARS ROVERS==

=========
Comments:
=========
- boikoro.marsrovers.MarsExpeditionAcceptanceTest - Acceptance test with input as in the task

- All classes are tested on unit level

- Using Hamcrest matchers could be easily avoided - but left for tests readability

- No javadoc annotations and comments in code - code should be self-explaining
  For example, main flow of application is described in boikoro.marsrovers.MarsExpeditionAcceptanceTest.getExpeditionResult():
	1. Input is parsed into LandingPlan
	2. MarsExpedition reads this landing plan
	3. MarsExpedition lands and moves rovers according to plan and generates LandingResultReport

- Direction.turnDirection() would be better to implement using cyclic bidirectional collection to move right/left,
  but no such collection in Java core, only in third-party libraries. Not reasonable as for me to write own one for this task

- Classes protected from unexpected change -
  thats why copies of values and not references to internal attributes
  are returned in getters (i.e. RoutePlan.getRoute())

- boikoro.marsrovers.Position is immutable, so we can return reference to it in getters
  (i.e. boikoro.marsrovers.RoutePlan.getInitialPosition, boikoro.marsrovers.Rover.getCurrentPosition).

============
Assumptions:
============
- If sequence of commands will move Rover out of plateau border - this Rover must crash during moving (throw an exception)
